# Air-quality-predictor
A Streamlit web app that predicts air quality and shows safety insights
🌍 Air Quality Predictor

This project predicts air quality levels based on environmental factors using Machine Learning.
It includes a trained ML model, a dataset, and a simple web interface built with Streamlit (or Flask, depending on what you used).

📌 Features

✅ Train and save an ML model (air_quality_model.pkl)
✅ Web app for making predictions (app.py)
✅ CLI/Script mode (main.py)
✅ Dataset included / linked for reproducibility
✅ Easy to run locally

⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/Dipanjan01-max/Air-quality-predictor.git
cd Air-quality-predictor


Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # for Linux/Mac  
venv\Scripts\activate       # for Windows  


Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

▶️ Usage
Run the web app
streamlit run app.py

Run the script directly
python main.py

Got it 👍 Since you’re making an Air Quality Predictor project with Python + ML model + CSV dataset, here’s a clean and professional README.md you can directly use (and tweak a little for your repo):

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains various environmental indicators (e.g., temperature, humidity, gas concentrations) used for predicting air quality.
Here is the dataset:

🧠 Model

Trained using Scikit-learn (or specify the algorithm you used like RandomForest, XGBoost, etc.).

Saved as a .pkl file for easy reusability.

📈 Future Improvements

Add support for real-time AQI data via APIs

Deploy model on Heroku / Streamlit Cloud / Hugging Face Spaces

Enhance accuracy with deep learning models
